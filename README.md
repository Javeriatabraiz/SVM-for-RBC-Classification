# SVM-for-RBC-Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the use of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classifying RBC data. The notebook walks through the entire process, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

**Overview**
The project focuses on applying an SVM to a dataset related to RBC. It covers essential steps such as:

Preparing the dataset for analysis.
Training an SVM model on the preprocessed data.
Evaluating the classifier's performance using standard metrics.
Visualizing the results to gain insights into the model's decision boundaries and overall effectiveness.
This notebook serves as a practical example for those interested in machine learning applications in biomedical data analysis or similar fields.
